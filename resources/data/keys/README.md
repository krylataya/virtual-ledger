## Various test data

### Private and public keys

`*.key` files.

Here are some keys, generated and commited here; feel free to use them for your experiments. They are test and compromised, but okay for development. Public ones are pushed to dcp.testpoint.io already (https://dcp.testpoint.io/urn:oasis:names:tc:ebcore:partyid-type:iso6523:0151::11002814548/keys/ for example, replace 1100... to the ABN from key filename).

### Encrypted messages

`signed_*.json` and `signed_*.json.hash` are encrypted TAP messagees with invoice.txt file encrypted; if you want to decrypt it then you have receiver private key here as well.

### Test ABNs

Let's claim some test ABNs and participant identifiers. I use these one sometimes:

* check numbers in `*.key` files

TODO:

* describe abn for next test services:

  * nry.testpoint.io
  * tradewire.io
  * ...
